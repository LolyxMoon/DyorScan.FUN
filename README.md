## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dyor.git
cd dyor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

4. Set up Supabase:

Create a new Supabase project and run this SQL in the SQL editor:

```sql
create table public.dyor_scans (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  contract_address text not null,
  result_json jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create index dyor_scans_contract_address_idx
  on public.dyor_scans (contract_address);
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. Enter a Solana token contract address in the scanner
2. Wait for the analysis to complete (typically 3-5 seconds)
3. Review the comprehensive report including:
   - Narrative claim and entities
   - Verdict (CONFIRMED/PARTIAL/UNVERIFIED) with confidence level
   - Market data and metrics
   - Security analysis
   - Red flags (if any)
   - Detailed reasoning and notes

4. Export results as PDF or copy the full report

## Telegram Bot

DYOR Scanner is also available as a Telegram bot! Analyze tokens directly in Telegram by sending contract addresses to the bot.

### Features

- Instant token analysis via Telegram
- Same powerful AI analysis as the web app
- Real-time market data and security checks
- Simple conversational interface
- No need to open a browser

### Quick Start

1. Get a Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY` to your `.env` file
3. Run: `npm run bot`
4. Start chatting with your bot!

For detailed setup instructions, see [TELEGRAM_BOT_SETUP.md](./TELEGRAM_BOT_SETUP.md)

## API

### Endpoint

```
POST /api/scan
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "contractAddress": "string (required)",
  "forceRefresh": boolean (optional, default: false)
}
```

### Response

```json

}
```

## Understanding Verdicts

### CONFIRMED
The narrative references real, verifiable events, products, or announcements. Entities mentioned are real. **Note**: This does NOT mean the token is officially affiliated or safe.

### PARTIAL
The narrative mixes truth with hype or exaggeration. Real events may be referenced, but claims are stretched or imply unofficial associations.

### UNVERIFIED
The narrative's claims cannot be verified through available information. Entities or events may be fabricated, misleading, or too vague to verify. Exercise extreme caution.

## Limitations & Disclaimers

- **Not Financial Advice**: DYOR Scanner provides analysis, not investment advice. Always do your own research.
- **No Guarantees**: Verdicts are AI-generated assessments, not definitive truth. Use as one tool among many.
- **Data Accuracy**: We rely on third-party APIs. Data may be incomplete or delayed.
- **Narrative vs Reality**: A CONFIRMED verdict means the narrative references real events, NOT that the token is legitimate or safe.
- **Always DYOR**: This tool is meant to assist your research, not replace it.
